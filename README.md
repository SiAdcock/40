# 40

- I'll start off by saying thanks to everyone for coming and thanks to the Trusty Servant for hosting us.
- If anyone was at our wedding, you'll either remember that my speech was rubbish or you've forgotten it even happened, so I'll keep this one short.
- 40 years
- They say a 40 year old equals 2 20 year olds
- I reckon that's true. I can't recognise what I was even thinking when I was 20
- I remember a 20 year old me waking up and thinking "God I'm old". Mate.
- But let's go back further
- A 5 year old me, in Reception class. Teacher asked what do you wish for. I said "I wish I wouldn't die." She said that's a long way off. How the hell would she know?
- I went through several future-thinking phases when I was growing up. I wanted to join the Navy at one point. I wanted to be a psychologist, a scene of crime officer.
- But programmer and especially web developer was the thing that always stuck with me.
- I never thought I'd have kids. I never thought I'd have a girlfriend. I never thought I'd meet any true friends.
- But I needn't have worried. I met Angie, the best life partner I could ever have imagined. I have kids, Alex and Artemis, I could not have hoped to meet a better pair of kids.
- I got my dream job
- And I met you lot!
- I spent so much of my early life worried about the future.
- And now, at 40, my head is in the past
- Lost time due to COVID
- What about all those people I've lost touch with,?
- I can count on one hand the people here that I've known for less than 10 years
- That's not counting people who have been alive less than 10 years
- This gives me hope. Hope for a future, a beautiful future for all of us
- Thank you all for sticking with me. I love you. Let's not worry about the future, let's welcome it.
